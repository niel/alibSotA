version 0.3

Callbacks:
ui.onInit() -- called on the first update. used to initialize variable and such things
ui.onConsoleInput(type, src, dst, msg) -- called when text is entered or arrived in the chat window an it is not a command. type = message type, src = message from name, dst = message to name, msg = message
ui.onConsoleCommand(cmd, src, dst, arg) -- called when a command (message starts with\) is entered or arrived. cmd = commad, src = message from name, dst = message to name, arg = first argument
ui.onUpdate() -- called on each frame. please use setInterval or setTimeout instead.

Timers:
int id = setInterval(interval, callback) -- executes callback each interval seconds
int id = setTimeout(timeout, callback) -- executes callback when timeout is reached
cancelTimer(id) -- cancel a timer

Label:
int id = createLabel(left, top, width, height, text) -- creates a new label. labels are not shown, so you can create your ui without distortion. left and top can be "c", that means center
table label = getLabel(index) -- returns the label
table text = getLabelText(index) -- returns the text object of the label. (current returns string -- text not working, yet)
setLabelString(index, string) -- sets the caption of the labels text object (currently use setLabelText(index, text))
removeLabel(index) -- removes a label
showLabel(index) -- set labels visibility to true
hideLabel(index) -- set labels visibility to false
moveLabelBy(index, x, y) -- move label relative to its current position. x and y are deltas
moveLabelTo(index, x, y) -- move label to the position given by x and y

ui.label, ui.text and ui.timer can also be accessed directly.

client.started -- time when the client was started
client.fps -- shows current fps
client.accuracy --
client.screen.width -- width of client window
client.screen.heigh -- height of client window
client.screen.isFullScreen -- tells if client is used in fullscreen mode

player.name -- Name of the logged in avatar
player.x() -- returns x position of the avatar
player.y() -- returns y position of the avatar
player.z() -- returns z position of the avatar
player.health() -- returns current health of the avatar
player.focus() -- returns current focus of the avatar
player.stat(index) -- return stat info. stat.name = name of stat, stat.number = number of stat, stat.value = value of stat, stat.description = description of stat (not working in 885)

player.name is set when the player send a message from the console/chat window. it may be used to check if the sender of a message is the player
As long no player.name is set, ui.onConsoleCommand is not invoked.
Usually typing \command in the console will set the player.name. so ui.onConsoleCommand should work without problems.

Things todo:
getting text object to work
windows containing objects -> labels, progressbar, statusbar, table and giving the window a z-index
notify object
caching stat name/number for name / number lookup
client.language
